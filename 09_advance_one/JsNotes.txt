Javascript (default js)
    -->Synchrounous
    -->Single Thread
Execution Context: global execution context
    -->execute one line of code at a time
    -->each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing
    |-->console log->1
    |-->console log->2 

    and we have call stack and memory heap

Blocking Code
    -->block the flow of program
    ->Read File Sync
    
Non-Blocking Code
    -->Does not block execution
    -->Read File Async

Web API responsibility:
    -->Do the work and remind after certain period of time


 Execution of js:
    --> program executed
    --> call stack build
    --> in call stack global execution context build
    -->load all the functions and when execution of function complete it will pop out from the queue
    -->
